## Android Resources

### Lock Pattern Wordlist

[Pattern.7z](https://github.com/Digital-Forensics-Discord-Server/LawEnforcementResources/blob/main/pattern.7z) includes an Android Lock Pattern Wordlist taken from over 15,000 actual cases worked. The first 88 patterns should match about 80% of the commonly used lock patterns. Special thanks to [Bjoern Kerler](https://github.com/bkerler) for providing this to the DFIR community.
